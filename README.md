## Description

The **Anti Double Tapping Project** is a software solution designed to eliminate the *double tapping* issue in keyboards. *Double tapping* occurs when a key is pressed once, but the system registers multiple inputs, causing frustration and reducing productivity. This project aims to efficiently and reliably address this problem, improving the user experience while typing.

## Features

- **Smart Detection**: Identifies and filters duplicate inputs caused by *double tapping*.
- **Customization**: Allows adjusting sensitivity and response time for different types of keyboards.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Consumes minimal system resources without affecting overall performance.

## How It Works

The software monitors keyboard inputs in real-time and applies an algorithm to distinguish between intentional key presses and *double tapping* events. When *double tapping* is detected, the duplicate event is discarded, ensuring only the correct input is processed.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
