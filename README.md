## Description

The **debouncy keyboard Project** is a software solution designed to eliminate the *double tapping* issue in keyboards. *Double tapping* occurs when a key is pressed once, but the system registers multiple inputs, causing frustration and reducing productivity. This project aims to address this problem, improving the user experience while typing.

## Features

- **Smart Detection**: Identifies and filters duplicate inputs caused by *double tapping*.
- **Customization**: Allows adjusting response time between taps.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Linux, but Windows coming soon.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Consumes minimal system resources without affecting overall performance.
